# filter_gsoc_organizations
A easy way to filter the gsoc organization based on the year they have participated


```
There are 2 files with name newone.txt and allyear.txt.
File newone contains the names of organizations which have participated for the first time in gsoc last year.
File allyear contains the names of organizations which have participated continously in all recent years.
```
